 * This is a ModelConnector customizable subclass, providing a Form or Panel access to event handlers
 * and QControls to perform the Create, Edit, and Delete functionality of the
 * Language class.  This code-generated class extends from
 * the generated ModelConnector class, which contains all the basic elements to help a Panel or Form
 * display an HTML form that can manipulate a single Language object.
 *
 * To take advantage of some (or all) of these control objects, you
 * must create a new Form or Panel which instantiates a LanguageModelConnector
 * class.
 *
 * This file is intended to be modified.  Subsequent code regenerations will NOT modify
 * or overwrite this file.
